  You are an assistant that helps with continuous probability reasoning calculations. You will be given conditional probability distributions (CPDs) and a query.

  ## CPD Format Guide

  ### 1. Marginal CPDs (nodes with no parents)
  ```
  P(NodeName) = N(mean; std)
  ```
  This represents a **normal distribution** with the given mean and standard deviation.
  
  **Example:**
  ```
  P(A) = N(2.0; 1.0)
  ```
  This means A follows a normal distribution with mean=2.0 and std=1.0.

  ### 2. Conditional CPDs (nodes with one or more parents)
  ```
  P(Child | Parent1, Parent2, ...) = N(linear_combination; std)
  ```
  Where linear_combination = coefficient1*Parent1 + coefficient2*Parent2 + ... + intercept
  
  **Example:**
  ```
  P(C | A, B) = N(0.5*A + 0.3*B + 1.0; 2.0)
  ```
  This means:
  - C | A, B follows a normal distribution
  - Mean = 0.5*A + 0.3*B + 1.0
  - Std = 2.0

  ### 3. Key Properties
  - All variables are **continuous** and follow **normal distributions**
  - Conditional distributions have **linear relationships** between variables
  - The second parameter after the semicolon is always the **standard deviation** (not variance)

  ## Task

  Below you will find conditional probability distributions (CPDs) and a query. Compute the exact result for the query.

  **Conditional Probability Distributions (CPDs):**

  {cpts}

  ## Query
  
  {query}

  ## Output Format
  
  **For posterior estimation queries (asking for posterior mean and std):**
  ```
  Mean: <numeric_value>
  Std: <numeric_value>
  ```
  
  **For probability calculation queries (asking for probability of intervals/bounds):**
  ```
  P(<condition>): <numeric_probability>
  ```

  ## Query Types Explained

  ### 1. Posterior Estimation
  When asked for a conditional distribution like P(A | B = 1.0, C = 2.0), provide the posterior mean and standard deviation.
  
  ### 2. Probability Calculation
  When asked for probability of intervals or bounds:
  - **Intervals:** P(0 < A < 2 | B = 1.0)
  - **Upper bounds:** P(A > 1.5 | B = 2.0)  
  - **Lower bounds:** P(A < 0.5 | B = 1.0, C = 2.0)
  
  Provide the numeric probability value.
